                <h2>What is Microtia?</h2>
                <p>Microtia is a big word for a "Little Ear." It's a congenital condition where a baby is born with an outer ear (pinna) that is smaller than usual or shaped differently. The word comes from Latin: "micro" meaning small, and "otia" meaning ear.</p>
                <p>Microtia occurs in approximately 1 in 6,000 to 12,000 births, though rates can vary by geography and ethnicity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Types and Grades</h2>
                <p>Microtia is typically classified into four grades:</p>
                <div class="info-grid">
                    <div class="info-card-resource">
                        <h3>Grade I</h3>
                        <p>The ear is smaller than normal but all structures are present. This is the mildest form.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="info-card-resource">
                        <h3>Grade II</h3>
                        <p>The ear is partially formed with some recognizable structures but appears smaller and differently shaped.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="info-card-resource">
                        <h3>Grade III</h3>
                        <p>Only a small remnant of ear tissue is present, often resembling a peanut shape. This is the most common form.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="info-card-resource">
                        <h3>Grade IV (Anotia)</h3>
                        <p>Complete absence of the external ear. This is the rarest form.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Aural Atresia</h2>
                <p>Many children with Microtia also have aural atresia, which means the ear canal is narrow, absent, or closed. This can affect hearing on the affected side because sound waves cannot reach the inner ear through the normal pathway.</p>
                <p>However, the inner ear is often fully functional, which means bone conduction hearing devices can be very effective.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Causes</h2>
                <p>In most cases, the cause of Microtia is unknown. It is generally believed to occur during the first trimester of pregnancy when the ear structures are forming.</p>
                <p>Possible contributing factors may include:</p>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li>Genetic factors (though most cases are not hereditary)</li>
                    <li>Environmental factors during pregnancy</li>
                    <li>Reduced blood flow to the developing ear</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Microtia is not caused by anything the parents did or did not do during pregnancy. It is not preventable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Hearing and Communication</h2>
                <p>Children with unilateral (one-sided) Microtia typically have normal hearing in their other ear and can develop speech and language normally without intervention.</p>
                <p>Many children, like Nellie in our story, adapt beautifully by:</p>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li>Positioning themselves strategically in group settings</li>
                    <li>Developing enhanced visual awareness and lip-reading skills</li>
                    <li>Using their intuition and observational skills</li>
                    <li>Learning sign language alongside spoken language</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Treatment and Intervention Options</h2>
                <p>Families have several paths to consider. There is no single "right" choice, every family's decision is personal and valid.</p>

                <h3>Hearing Amplification</h3>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li><strong>Bone Conduction Headbands:</strong> Soft headbands that hold a sound processor against the skull (suitable for infants and young children)</li>
                    <li><strong>BAHA (Bone Anchored Hearing Aid):</strong> A surgically implanted titanium post that connects to a sound processor</li>
                    <li><strong>Ponto Systems:</strong> Similar to BAHA, another bone conduction implant option</li>
                    <li><strong>Traditional Hearing Aids:</strong> In some cases where there is a partial ear canal</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Surgical Reconstruction</h3>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li><strong>Rib Graft Reconstruction:</strong> Using the child's own rib cartilage to create an ear framework (typically done around age 6-10)</li>
                    <li><strong>Medpor Reconstruction:</strong> Using synthetic materials for ear reconstruction</li>
                    <li><strong>Ear Canal Surgery (Atresia Repair):</strong> Creating or opening an ear canal (success varies)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Prosthetic Ears</h3>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li>Custom-made silicone ears that attach to the head</li>
                    <li>Can be very realistic in appearance</li>
                    <li>Non-surgical option</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>No Intervention</h3>
                <p>Many families choose to embrace their child's natural appearance and focus on functional hearing support only, or no intervention at all. This is a completely valid choice.</p>
            </div>

                <h2>Important Things to Know</h2>
                <div class="callout-box">
                    <h3>Your Child is Not Broken</h3>
                    <p>Microtia is a difference, not a disability. Children with Microtia are capable, resilient, and amazing. They don't miss a beat.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="callout-box">
                    <h3>There is No Rush</h3>
                    <p>Aside from early hearing assessment and monitoring, most decisions about intervention can wait. Take your time. Learn. Connect with other families. Your child will help guide you.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="callout-box">
                    <h3>Let Your Child Lead</h3>
                    <p>As children grow, they develop their own feelings about their ears and their options. Their voice matters most in decisions about their body.</p>
