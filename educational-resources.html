                            <li>Answer questions honestly and simply</li>

                <h2>For Teachers: Creating an Inclusive Classroom</h2>
                <p>When you have a student with Microtia or any visible difference, you have an opportunity to create a culture of acceptance and curiosity.</p>

                <h3>Proactive Strategies</h3>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li><strong>Read inclusive books regularly:</strong> Make <em>Little Ear, Big Heart</em> and other diverse books part of your routine, not just when addressing a specific situation</li>
                    <li><strong>Celebrate differences year-round:</strong> Create ongoing discussions about uniqueness, not one-off lessons</li>
                    <li><strong>Partner with families:</strong> Ask parents how they'd like you to address their child's difference with classmates</li>
                    <li><strong>Empower the child:</strong> Some children may want to share about their difference; others may not. Follow their lead</li>
                    <li><strong>Address unkind behavior immediately:</strong> Treat comments about differences the same way you'd address any unkind behavior</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Classroom Accommodations for Microtia</h3>
                <p>Most children with unilateral Microtia do not require formal accommodations, but consider:</p>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li><strong>Preferential seating:</strong> Allow the child to sit where they can hear best (usually with their hearing ear toward the class)</li>
                    <li><strong>Visual supports:</strong> Use visual aids and written instructions alongside verbal directions</li>
                    <li><strong>Noise reduction:</strong> Minimize background noise during instruction when possible</li>
                    <li><strong>Check for understanding:</strong> Periodically confirm the child heard and understood instructions</li>
                    <li><strong>Buddy system:</strong> For fire drills or loud environments, pair with a buddy who can help ensure communication</li>
                </ul>
