                    <div class="underline"></div>
                    <p>Microtia is a big word for a "Little Ear." It's a condition where a child is born with an outer ear that is smaller than usual or shaped uniquely.</p>
                    <p>But a little ear doesn't mean a little spirit. Children with Microtia are resilient, adaptable, and capable. They might listen differently, instead using more of their eyes, intuition, and hearts, but they don't miss a beat.</p>
                    <p><strong>Little Ear, Big Heart</strong> celebrates this uniqueness. It's not just a story about fitting in; it's a story about standing tall and being proud of who you are.</p>

                    <p class="author-bio">I'm Jacob Rosales, and I wrote <em>Little Ear, Big Heart</em> for my daughter Nellie, who was born with Microtia on October 27th, 2022.</p>
                    <p>When Nellie was born, my wife and I made a choice: we would never treat her difference as a deficit. Instead, we celebrate it as part of what makes her extraordinary.</p>
                    <p>And extraordinary she is.</p>
                    <p>Despite having Microtia, Nellie attends the Texas School for the Deaf and is already trilingual. She signs ASL, speaks Spanish and English, and knows exactly which language to use with each person based on how they communicate with her. Microtia hasn't held her back; it has propelled her forward.</p>
                    <p>My wife and I believe that Nellie's confidence starts with our confidence. We are advocates who speak openly about her condition.</p>
                    <p>When people stare, we don't get defensive. We invite them to ask questions. We explain. We educate. We show them that Nellie isn't limited by a label; she is defined by her brilliance.</p>
                    <p>This book is our way of extending that conversation to every family, every classroom, and every child who needs to hear that different is not just okay. It's awesome.</p>
                    <p class="author-dedication">"To Nellie. You are perfect exactly as you are."</p>

                        <h3>The Beautiful Reality</h3>
                        <p>But that video is just one chapter. Today, Nellie tells us, "I can hear fine!" and chooses to go without her device 90% of the time.</p>
                        <p>Why? Because like Sam in our book, she has become a Detective. She relies on her intuition, her eyes, and her own unique way of listening to navigate the world. The device is a tool she can use, but her confidence is the superpower she always uses.</p>
